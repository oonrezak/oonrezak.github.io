### Project Summary
Politics is a hot topic in the Philippines. The situation in this country is a very colorful one, with long-lasting political rivalries that turn into feuds, dynasties that span several generations, and even illegal activities such as vote-buying.

In 2019, national-level elections were highlighted by the senatorial race. Two main factions emerged - those aligned with the administration and those who opposed it. Public opinion on each of these two sides has been especially polarizing recently following the rise of the controversial president Rodrigo Duterte.

Candidates for political positions have much to benefit by analyzing the electoral tendencies of the population. This project aims to analyze some of the patterns that emerged during this election, and give insights for the next elections in 2022.
